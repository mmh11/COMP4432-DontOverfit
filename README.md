# COMP4432-DontOverfit
COMP4432 Personal Project

In this assessment, I have participated in this Kaggle competition “Don't Overfit!
II”, which aims to avoid training a model that is too closely fit to a limited set of data
and lose the generalization ability. In addition, the older version of the dataset in this
competition will be used. The final scores of my best attempt are 0.724 (private score)
and 0.732 (public score).
